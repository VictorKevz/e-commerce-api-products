Welcome to the **E-Commerce API Products** project! This is a simple and responsive e-commerce application built with modern web technologies. It demonstrates basic e-commerce functionalities such as adding items to a cart, updating quantities, and removing items from the cart. The project is built using **ReactJS**, **Vite**, and the **dummyJSON API** for fetching product data.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Future Enhancements

- **Image Slider for Each Product**: Implement an image slider to showcase multiple images for each product.
- **LightBox Feature**: Add a LightBox feature for a full-screen view of product images.

- **Enhanced Filtering**: Add more filtering options such as categories, brands, and ratings.
